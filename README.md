## Get started
Install packages dependencies.

```sh
$ cd training
$ npm install
```

### Change the .envexample to .env
Modify the .env at the root to point to your database (you have a .envexample you can use)

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and you should see the app running.
